# Installation:
Google Chrome: You will need to install this script using the [Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo). This way the script should be able to run nicely and you will also benefit from automatic updates when new version are available.

Firefox: You will obviously need the [Greasemonkey addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) addon to be able to install and use this script. If you are using Firefox 30+ you need to make sure you use Greasemonkey version 2.2+ or the script won't work.
